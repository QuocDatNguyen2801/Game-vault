      "Grand theft auto 5 is a game that set a standard for other games that came after, it broke records and broke our minds back in the day The story is over the top action stuff at the layer, but is filled with excellent writing and performances. The main characters are well written and have some good depth. The open world is beautiful, back in 2013 it was something nobody has never seen before, something so realistic and awesome. It ditches the dark/gritty tone of grand theft auto iv for a more fun experience. The driving is amazing unlike its predecessor.(Yes less realistic, but more fun) the shooting is fun, but I personally felt the shooting in gta 4 felt more satisfying, they should've improved upon it. The physics was also dumbed down, and I loved the physics in gta 4. Those are minor issues though. The map is huge, but honestly there is nothing much going on in that map. They fixed that problem in red dead redemption 2, but it could have had much more. Honestly Micheal and trevor were well written but franklin is just not as as good as them. He was fine but, he did not have much depth if you ask me. Over all, the story is good, the gameplay is great, and its worth playing"

I am not one of those who played the original, so I played this game with no expectations and with no fond memories of those heroes, so my opinion is not biased in favor of FF7 Remake. The story is not good. The main cast and the group they belong to, Avalanche, an environmental terrorist group, is just the worst group I have seen so far.",
      "Their sole motivation is that the Shinra company is bleeding the world dry, so they commit terrorist acts and blow up Mako reactors, which could have catastrophic effects on the humans living around those reactors. In the end, with the help of Shinra, those reactor explosions become a huge catastrophe, and this also results in Shinra’s backlash toward Avalanche. Many, many bystanders die because of that. Barret says after he blew up the first reactor that he knew this was going to be messy, but it's a price he is willing to pay. Dude. I liked some of the characters during their small conversations, but overall, they are all just horrible terrorists. That does not make the Shinra company any worse or better.",
      "That was what I disliked about the story, and anyone not seeing any problem with that should rethink their stance toward human life. Gameplay-wise, I disliked the many, almost never-ending slow walk areas and the crawl areas. The side quests were also just horrible fetch quests. The game settings are also very un-fantasy-like, always in a slum, between rubble or just metal.",
      "So in total, this is a high production dumpster fire, and in my opinion, anyone who likes this game either has low expectations from games, is easy to please, or is just a massive fan of the original. Maybe I did expect too much and got disappointed? I would not recommend paying more than 20 bucks for this game."

Even though the narrative can be a bit convoluted at moments, the selling point of that game for me was the characters, their interactions, and their development. Not to mention all of the big impactful moments that keep this story so iconic and memorable. Final Fantasy VII Remake is a game that has a lot of things holding it back from true greatness in my eyes, but it still has exceptional things about it.",
      " It’s beautiful visually, Midgar has so much detail put into it, the soundtrack is phenomenal, there are plenty of funny moments kept from the original game, the combat is extremely fun and innovative, and my favorite part of the game is the characters, their interactions, and development throughout the story. For the original FF7, the English translation for the game wasn’t completely accurate, so the way characters are portrayed in it isn’t exactly accurate to how they are. For Remake, however, the writing of the characters was handled with so much love and care, and it’s awesome to see them being brought to life in this remake and see their growth with one another by the end of the game, especially Cloud. Cloud went from being a snobby, selfish **** at the beginning of the game to a more caring, heroic, and compassionate man who ends up genuinely caring about others.",
